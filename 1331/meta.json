I thought I would give it a try and compare it to other compression programs: gzip, bzip2, and zip. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this new algorithm, DELIMINATE, is much slower at decompression than the others, it is much quicker at compression and achieves the best compression ratio. \u003cem\u003eNote: this video limits the idle time for each command to 5 seconds, so just refer to the runtimes on the command line for comparison.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper is available at \u003ca href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/19/2527.short\"\u003ehttp://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/19/2527.short\u003c/a\u003e. The program was easy enough to obtain and use and worth consideration for managing NGS data. There is still the practical question though of whether the improved compression speed and compression ratio warrants having yet another compression program accessible on every system you frequently use, especially given the slower decompression speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","Time":"2012-10-04T02:34:44Z","Tags":["OS X","bash","xterm-256color"]}
